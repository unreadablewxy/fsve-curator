# fsve-curator
fs-viewer extension to query and manage collections managed by fs-curator

## How to install

For now there's no UI experience for managing extensions in the `fs-viewer` project. So all installations must be done manually.

1. Build this extension & generate symblinks
```bash
npm install && npm run link
```

2. Open the application level preferences in your favorite text editor
  * `~/.config/fs-viewer/config.json` (for linux users)
  * `%APPDATA%/fs-viewer/config.json` (for windows users)
  
3. Add the following property to the JSON file
```json
{
  "extensions":["fsve-curator"]
}
```

Note: Assume pre-alpha, "it works on my box", level of quality. It can't harm your files, but it might not work for your setup.
